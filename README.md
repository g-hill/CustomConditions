# Custom Conditions - Because Mother Nature Needs a Co-Pilot! üõ©Ô∏è

*Please let me know if you find any unusual bugs or things I missed - and leave a review or comment so I know if it's helpful for you. Thanks!*

## Overview

Ever wished you could instantly transform your perfectly dry runway into a challenging winter wonderland? Or maybe add just a touch of "excitement" with some light ice? Are you looking out the window and seeing snow, but X-Plane is telling you NO!?

Well, now you can! **Custom Conditions** lets you play weather wizard without messing up your METAR data. It works great for those days when X-Plane isn't showing any snow/rain/ice, but you clearly see it on the ground.

## What's This All About?

X-Plane grabs current METAR and injects it into the sim. METAR doesn't show what's on the ground; it only shows what's reported in the sky. Did it snow for the past two weeks, but X-Plane is showing green grass? This is for you.

**Custom Conditions** is your new favorite tool for:
- Testing your landing skills in **X-Plane 12**
- Experiencing scenic routes through winter wonderlands
- Practicing slick runway landings
- Flying in Santa's snowy north
- Feeling brave enough to tackle maximum ice conditions

All this while keeping your actual weather settings intact!

## How It Works

Really simply. It just changes a single **dataref** to adjust how X-Plane sees the environment and its conditions. Nothing fancy.

**Compatibility:** X-Plane **v12+ only.**
